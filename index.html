<h1> The Diary of Anne Frank </h1>
<h2> A Brief History </h2>
<img src = "annefrank.jpg">
<p>Annes first yearsAnne Frank was born in the German city of Frankfurt am Main in 1929. Anneâ€™s sister Margot was three years her senior. Unemployment was high and poverty was severe in Germany, and it was the period in which Adolf Hitler and his party were gaining more and more supporters. Hitler hated the Jews and blamed them for the problems in the country. He took advantage of the rampant antisemitic sentiments in Germany. The hatred of Jews and the poor economic situation made Anne's parents, Otto and Edith Frank, decide to move to Amsterdam. There, Otto founded a company that traded in pectin, a gelling agent for making jam.
